Hi, my name is Jose.
I want to become a competent data analyst. I want to add this skill to my economics and public policy background. 
I am passionate about sustainability, economic development and social welfare policies.
I am at the start of my career and the possibilities seem endless at times,
but if I can become a proficient and skilled data analyst,
I feel I would be better equipped to any career path. 
Please help me on my journey, hopefully soon I can start being an asset to the Github community. 
The first step in the right direction, I feel is building a portfolio. 
Currently I am doing the Google Analytics certificate to build upon some basic SQL, Excel and R skills. 
Take care, and thank you for reading this far!
Cheers,
Jose
